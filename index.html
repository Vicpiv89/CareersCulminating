		<h3 class="col-12 subtitle">Setting a goal</h3>
		<img src="targeticon.png" alt="target icon" class="col-4 target">
		<h5 class="col-12">I have not yet set a goal for my future, so this assignment will help me to do so. Over the span of this course, I've learned how to manage my time, stay organized, keep a balance beetween work and life, and many other valuable skills and lessons to help me determine what I am capable of doing in my future. Now, although I have generally wished to go to university for a bachelors degree in computer science, I am starting to realize that such a degree is almost always not necessary to work as a web/software developer, which is what I want to do in the future. So, I think the goal I will set is to learn the skills and information I need to, in order to find a full-time job as a full-stack web developer before, or within the year after school school ends.

		<h5 class="col-12">
			Below is a list of things I need to consider in my path towards reaching my goal. These will be subtopics in the reflection.
			<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Finances - Budgeting, Saving, Expenses</li>
				<li>Online Profile - How do I present myself online?</li>
				<li>Personal Profile - What are my values, strengths and skills & how can I use them to succeed?</li>
				<li>Career Path - How will I study & gain experience?</li>
				<li>School Path - How will I perform the best I can in school?</li>
				<li>Time management - Can I organize my time to get everything done while ensuring a proper work-life balance?</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 class="col-12 subtitle">Finances</h3>

		<h5 class="col-12"> Now I have chosen that, rather than university, I will aim to find a job as a full-stack web developer. University will still be a second possibilty if my initial plan does not end up succeeding, and I will talk about this possibility rather than the full-stack web developer possibility, as that would simply require working from home, which, for a few years, would still be my parents home, and finances would not be a major issue. <br> <br>

		For the possibility of going to university, I made a <a href="Budgetassignmentcareers.pdf">cost and income chart in assignment 9</a> (pdf file may be formatted incorrectly). This chart describes the major costs I would have through the first year of university, and how I would be able to afford them. Although the plan seems ideal, there is a possibility that I would be unable to work a part-time job while studying at university, and in this case, support through a loan or help using the Ontario Student Asistance Program would be two actions I would be able to take.

		<h3 class="col-12 subtitle">My Online Profile</h3>

		<h6 class="col-12">
			My online/public profile is something I have had to consider already before. I want to present myself professionaly and positively online, and there are many ways this can be done. First, knowing everything I post is permanent, I need to be cautious and thoughtful about what I write, post, and comment online. Writing a good resume, or perhaps creating a unique portfolio about myself is very important for future employment and image. One way I thought about doing this is by creating a website about my accomplishments, experience, and education. This will not only help people better understand me as a person, but it can also represent my interest and passion for building applications and websites.
			<br>
			<br>
			Another important thing for my public profile is social media. For example, Instagram. I could use this app inappropriately or present a bad image of myself, or I could use it to promote myself. Some things I could do to make my Instagram account professional would be to use appropriate names and captions, post about my accomplishments and useful events I participated in, and of course, make sure I am not posting anything that will create a bad image of myself.
			<br>
			<br>
			Throughout my career, I will need to develop resume writing skills, the ability to write good formal emails and write honest but attractive cover letters to help find employment oopportunities in the future.

		<h3 class="col-12 subtitle">My Personal Profile</h3>

		<h6 class="col-12 needshrink"> My personal profile consists of a list of my skills, strengths, and values. I will determine these, and consider how I can make them valuable and use them to succeed in my future career. <br> <br>
		First, my skills. I would say that my skills are communication, critical thinking, problem solving, and experience with technology. I think that every skill is useful for careers of course, but these would specifically help me grow and improve as a web developer. Communication is critical for this role, as it's usually virtual. I need to know how to efficiently and formally write e-mails, join calls, and communicate with people online in many other ways. critical thinking and probrem solving are somewhat similar. I think these are useful skills in the world of programming where many issues can come up, and solutions are not always found by simply googling. Finally, experience with technology is also obviously critical for the web developerpath, as I would need to be able to use the right programs, know how to upload, convert, push, and render files in/to websites, as well as know how to program this files individually. <br> <br>
		Now, my strengths. I think my major strengths are collaboration, leadership, and organization. I consider myself to be very well organized, completing tasks on time throughout not only this course, but the entire year so far. This will be a key aspect in work in the future, especially if I were to work for a business who create softwares for companies, because these projects would have strict "due dates". This would aslo apply if i were to work as a freelancer. Collaboration, may not be as important depending on the route I take, but any company or business I work for, instead of myself, will require the capability to collaborate and communicate with colleagues. Finally leadership. I consider myself to be a strong leader. I help others when they are in need, and I have volunteered in programs to teach programming to children, as well as the Canada Learning Code Teen Ambassador program. This strength is very useful and important to have, to show that I am a good colleague in the future and that I am able to ask for help, or help others when I can. <br><br>
		Finally are my values. I don't like to speak about my cultural values, but I can talk about my work values. I believe that everyone should earn what they deserve to earn, based on the amount of work they put in. In this case, this would require me to work hard to achieve success in the future, and I know I am able to do so.

		<h6 class="col-12">
			My career path is not simply the job I want in the future, but how I will make my way to it, from now until I get to working my dream job. Currently, I am at a stage where I have learned the basis of what I need to know for a front-end web developer job (I want to work as a full-stack web developer). To begin my career, I have found a resource called <a href="https://roadmap.sh/">roadmap</a>. This roadmap helps me understand what I need to learn to be able to make my way to a full-stack web developer (I am taking the react path). Although this would be ideal, I would first need some experience. For example, after I learn some more key features I could go onto <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a> to find small tasks I am able to do for people, at any cost. This would help me understan what working as a web developer will be like. After some experience as a freelancer, and more studying and learning, I can move on to apply for internships at companies (most likely in the summer). An internship will drastically improve my resume, and give me experience in a real software developing company. After some time, I will have gained enough experience and taught myself enough to be able to apply for a proper front-end web developer postion. After 1 or 2 years here, and some studying in my free time, I will be eligible to work as a full-stack web developer. I predict this will be within 2-4 years.

		<h6 class="col-12"> 
			This is the last subtopic in my reflection, and I think it may just be one of the most important ones. Although this is somewhat of a skill or strength that could just be added to mypersonla profile, I think it's one that stands out heavily and is very useful in my future. Managing my time means staying organized, thinking about my due dates, what I can focus more on, balancing work and life, and making sure I do have time to do all of my tasks. This is not something that I have been perfect with throughout the school year, but its most definitely improved since last year, and I plan on doing the same for the 11th grade. Learning how to save time for assignments, while also studying for my future career separately will not be easy, and I will have to make schedules, mark events on calendars, and keep myself from procrastinating (this is one of the biggest issues i've had this year).

		<h3 class="col-12 subtitle">School Path</h3>

		<h5 class="col-12"> My school path, despite technically not being necessary for my ideal job, is very important for my education, presentation, and future, as well as something I can resort to for work if my web development path does not work out. My school path is quite simple. I will take the courses I think will be most useful to me in my future, and I will perform the best I can throughout the school year. Using my skills, strengths, and work values from my personal profile, I can figure out ways that I can efficiently and creatively work throughout school to achieve good grades and learning skills.
